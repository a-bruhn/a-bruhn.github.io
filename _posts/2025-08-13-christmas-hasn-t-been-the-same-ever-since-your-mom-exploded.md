You still won't sit in the front seat. You're staying in your dark cave in the back as I'm charging the car. I hand you your oat latte. You barely lift your head up from the collected poems of Chika Sagawa and utter a singular "thanks". The few steps from the car to the rest stop and back were enough to make me sweat. I have to take of my woolen hat and throw it onto the center console. The winter sun is hanging low over the torporic fields of Brandenburg. How incredible is it—I ask myself—that these rays, after having been trapped inside our sun for millennia, have just traversed the lonely depths of space only to land on my head and evaporate the thin film of salty fluid on my brow.

The monotonous droning of the road below is tiring. I'd ask you what you want to listen to but you've got your earbuds in. The disconnect is just so harsh. How can we make it better? Do we not have to, when we're all we have left for each other? How many times have I told you _I miss her, too_? It took hundreds of millions of years for these hills to rise and be shaped into their current state. I dread the thought that it may too take geological timescales to erode the sadness from your face. But we're humans. We may enter the thanatocene, but not emerge from it. 

I was a few years younger than you, when it happened to my father. On the summer of my 13th birthday, we went on a hiking trip in the black forest mountains in the deep south-west. It was a typical day in July, warm and with only few clouds in the sky. I vividly remember the sheer abundance of bees; their fleeting visitations among the wild flowers and weeds as if directed by some unknown magnetic flow. New field lines condensing around the myriad of nectaries while others broke up and vanished, as the generator beneath the earth continued its perpetual motion. Of course, I didn't think of it like this back then, but the imagery is what stayed with me, and I still often watch myself standing in this hillside meadow as the faint purple ribbons undulate through my body.

I must have stood there for a few minutes in total silence. Suddenly, a spray of liquid came over me. The smell of iron, a rosy mist settling gradually. If it hadn't been for these impressions, one could easily assume a sudden gust of wind had merely carried over water ejected from a nearby sprinkler, thus wetting an unprepared face. So unremarkable is the sound it makes. A hush, and all your corporal identity, the hands we touched each other with, the matter that holds our memories and thoughts, quietly transforms into warm humidity.
