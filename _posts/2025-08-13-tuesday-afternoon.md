To the late are left the bones:  
circumspect contortions,  
hours and hours of  
yogurt café reviews with  
therapy supplement sponsorships,  
the friction of misshapen thumbs  
that you can hear on silent days  
against the backdrop of—  
what exactly?  

And then, of course, there‘s us,  
the all around no-present.  
So fucking post-“it all“.  
As of yet, as promised, all for free—  
to the end of the end of the over-  
abundance/over-load of  
empathy  
of the first kind:  
of starving kittens, of  
derelict children or  
whatever.  
Hyperreal fixations  
for the survival of the user base,  
staked on aunts draped in red flags.  
Devoid of meaning,  
essentially, utterly.  
Delulu.
