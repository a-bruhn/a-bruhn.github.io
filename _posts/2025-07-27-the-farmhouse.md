Last September I decided to visit my uncle Phil and his wife Marie at their old farmhouse. I hadn't been there in many years and the last time I saw them was during my high school graduation. We always had a great relationship and messaged each other regularly. We even talked on the phone every couple of weeks, although he did most of the talking while Marie was always somewhere in the background saying a few words here and there. I knew he would be delighted to see me again and it was long overdue, but my motivation to do it then was in part selfish. I had just decided to switch majors, again. I just couldn't see myself in human resources. My parents, of course, were distraught. And I can totally see their point. I had promised them that this would be the right transition for me, something grounded and with good career opportunities, after I just couldn't take psychology any longer. I knew they would still support me, but after all the talking and negative aura, I just needed some affirmation by my favorite uncle. He always said that whatever decisions I make, the most important thing is that I do what feels right for me. I was young and what mattered was that I didn't rush into anything or just did something to please others. 

The house was located on a shallow slope and quite large. There was a large backyard with lots of homegrown produce and on the other side towards the hill a breathtaking wild meadow. It wasn't really that wild, as uncle Phil was always proud to proclaim, since it still needed a lot of effort to keep in its state, but the sheer diversity of wild flowers and weeds, the white, purple, red, and yellow patterns, was just so gorgeous, it really belonged on a wallpaper. The afternoon I visited, we sat in full view of it, below a giant oak tree, on a set of collapsible chairs around a metal garden table with a clipped-on rubbery tablecloth on it. All around us insects were buzzing about.

The house belonged to Marie's parents. After they died in the 00's, uncle Phil and her moved in. This meant being away from his brother (my father) and us at the coast, but how could you say no to such an estate. They sold off the farmland but kept the house and nearly two acres of garden.  Since then, the house itself has somewhat fallen into disrepair—not by much, but it was obvious that greater renovations were overdue. They never seemed like they had money problems: both had been successful in their careers and managed to retire way ahead of what the vast majority of people could even dream of, including my parents. On top of that, my uncle still composed for smaller movies and video games from time to time with considerable success. Somehow, yet, the house and shed seemed to only have received surface-level repairs over the last few decades.

Aunt Marie went to get coffee as we sat taking in the surroundings. I couldn't remember it being so beautiful here.

> _"Before you start contemplating too much again, let's have some coffee and sugar-cookies",_ Marie interjected, carrying a big carafe and an artfully plated dish, the cookies' large sugar crystals twinkling in the afternoon sun.

I had always loved these as a child, and even as a teenager during a time where I used to be a terribly picky eater, I would eat a dozen of those whenever we visited. Aunt Marie poured our coffee into the fine moss rose cups with fine pinkish enamled flowers—no doubt an heirloom from her family—that were placed out on the cheapish garden table. I relished in the contrast this provided. This more natural life was much different from the carefully crafted setting at coffee shops in the city or even my parents' house. I began to notive the smell of the coffee, however, which not mix well with the sweetness of the cookies and the late summer air. Looking closer at the cups, I could see lot's of micro-cracks in them, only visible due to the dark murky coffee filling into them, thus providing the required contrast to discover them. Given their age of at least a hundred years, they were still in very good shape, just not as immaculate as I had first presumed. Bringing the cup to my face, the smell of the coffee became harsher and nearly foul. Since there are all kinds of different types of coffee beans, I brought myself to take a sip, maybe this was a variety like those brewed from beans that were digested by monkeys before being picked up. I also didn't want to have them think I'm the typical caramel macchiato college student type (although in reality I really was). But, the taste was also terrible, it tasted slightly foul.

> _"I'm sorry, but do you think the beans might have gone bad? The coffee tastes a bit off."_
>
> _"Oh I'm so sorry dear, this is how it always tastes. We are not really connoisseurs, we just like to drink a cup here and there and buy our beans in a big bag, when we drive out to the big chain store. We don't even know what kind we're buying, we just take the cheapest one,"_ Marie replied.

> _"You are probably used to a lot better coffee at your university,"_ uncle Phil added. I could see a bit of earnest shame in his face.

I immediately felt embarassed having mentioned it. 

Sometimes it is just too late.
