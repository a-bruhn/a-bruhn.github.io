Last September, I decided to visit my uncle Phil and his wife Marie at their old farmhouse. I hadn't been there in many years, and the last time I saw them was at my high school graduation, when they flew over to visit. When I was younger, we had seen each other more regularly, but it's hard to stay close through the distance. My siblings became typical teenagers and therefore had not much interest in relationships you would have to put any effort into. After a few years went by, even my dad had mostly stopped talking about his brother. In spite of that, I always felt connected to my uncle, as though there was something similar in us, and we messaged each other regularly. I even talked on the phone with him and Marie every couple of weeks, although he did most of the talking while she was always somewhere in the background, doing some menial but seemingly important work around the house, faintly audible only when it was necessary to provide a helpful reminder or correction to my uncle's memory. 

The house stood imposingly on a shallow slope. Driving along the hilly countryside, I felt myself in awe as the off-white color of its wooden paneling emerged pastorally into view. I had to park some ways down the hill, since I hadn't booked early enough to snatch an off-road rental car. There was a large backyard with lots of homegrown produce and on the other side, facing the hill, a breathtaking wild meadow. It wasn't really that wild, as uncle Phil was always proud to proclaim, since it still needed a lot of effort to keep it in its current state, but the sheer diversity of wild flowers and weeds, the patterning of white, purple, red, and yellow petals, was just so pristine, I immediately regretted not packing my Z6. As a child, I had often imagined myself as a giant, my building-sized hands pressing into the oceanic surface to shape the motions of its waves. Now, observing the the relief of differently sized stalks, I could feel its texture brushing against my exaggerated palms. As I watched my titanic self carefully caress the landscape, I could sense a feeling of profound belonging from this creature seemingly placed in its natural habitat. That afternoon, after a brief and heartfelt welcome, we sat in full view of the meadow below a towering oak on a set of small collapsible chairs. The centerpiece of the arrangement was a metal garden table with one of these old-timey clipped-on rubbery tablecloths, that while somewhat comical still somehow seemed to fit perfectly into the scenery. Calm swept over me through touches of a rural sun I hadn't felt in years. We looked at each other, the sound of insects buzzing enveloping us.

I knew he would be delighted to see me again and it was long overdue, but my motivation to make the trip at that time in particular was in part selfish. I had recently decided to switch majors for a second time, much to the dismay of my parents. I just couldn't see myself in human resources. Not that I could see myself doing anything else exclusively for the next 50 years of my life, but at least it wouldn't be in HR. My parents, of course, had been distraught. And even then I could totally see their point. I had promised them before that this would be the right transition for me, something grounded and with good career opportunities, after I just couldn't take psychology any longer. I knew they would still support me, but after all the talking and negative aura, I just needed some affirmation by my favorite uncle. In typical uncle fashion, he had always assured me that I should do what feels right for me. I was young, so what really mattered in his mind was that I didn't rush into anything or feel pressured into doing something mainly to please others. 

The farm belonged to Marie's parents. After they died in the 00's, uncle Phil and her moved in. This meant being away from his brother (my father) and us at the coast, but Marie could not let go of her childhood home and how could anyone say no to such a gorgeous estate. They sold off the farmland but kept the house and nearly two acres of garden space.  Since then, the house itself has somewhat fallen into disrepair—not drastically, but it was obvious that greater renovations were overdue. They never seemed like they had money problems: both had been successful in their careers and managed to retire way ahead of what the vast majority of people could even dream of, including my parents. On top of that, my uncle still composed for smaller movies and video games from time to time with considerable success. And yet, somehow, the house and shed seemed to only have received surface-level repairs over the last few decades.

Aunt Marie went to get coffee as we sat, taking in the surroundings. I couldn't remember it being so beautiful here.

> _"I cannot imagine this ever getting old, uncle Phil. Everything is so alive."_
>
> _"You know, I've spent an uncountable amount of hours here. And you're right, it doesn't get old. It just feels more and more wistful with every year. You look out so much into the dawning meadow, the hills and everything—it makes you contemplate too much,"_ he said.
>
> _"Before you start to get lost in your thoughts again, let's have some coffee and sugar-cookies",_ Marie interjected with a noticably forced smile, carrying a big carafe and an artfully plated dish, the cookies' large sugar crystals twinkling in the afternoon sun.

I had always loved these as a child, and even as a teenager during a time when I used to be a terribly picky eater, I would eat a dozen of those whenever we visited. Aunt Marie poured our coffee into the fine moss rose cups with fine pinkish enameled flowers—no doubt an heirloom from her family—set out on the cheap-ish garden table. I relished in the contrast. This more natural life was much different from the carefully crafted setting at coffee shops in the city or even my parents' house. I began to notice the smell of the coffee, however, which didn't mix well with the sweetness of the cookies and the late summer air. Looking closer at the cups, I could see lots of tiny cracks in them, only visible due to the dark murky coffee filling into them, thus creating the contrast required to discover them. Given their age of at least a hundred years, they were still in very good shape, just not as immaculate as I had first presumed. Bringing the cup to my face, the smell of the coffee became harsher and nearly foul. Since there are all kinds of different types of coffee beans, I brought myself to take a sip. Maybe this was an exotic variety, like the one brewed from beans digested by monkeys. I also didn't want to have them think I'm the typical _caramel macchiato_ college student type (although in reality I really was). But—the taste was also terrible, maybe even slightly foul.

> _"I'm sorry, but do you think the beans might have gone bad? The coffee tastes a bit off."_
>
> _"Oh ,I'm so sorry dear, that's just how it always tastes. We're not exactly connoisseurs, we just like to drink a cup here and there and buy our beans in a 50 pound bag, when we drive out to the big chain store. We don't even know what kind we're buying, we just take the cheapest one,"_ Marie replied.
>
> _"You are probably used to a lot better coffee at your university,"_ uncle Phil added. I could see a bit of earnest shame in his face.

I immediately felt embarrassed having mentioned it. The conversation shifted to uncle Phil's newest project, an indie sci-fi film. I remember telling him how much I admired that he could work creatively and never had to be a corporate drone. He agreed, which brought us back to the topic of our last phone call, my studies. Uncle Phil assured me:

> _"I know you're still figuring things out in your life. I cannot stress enough how important it is that you don't rush and take the first path that just presents itself."
>
> _"I understand what you mean, but there is also a financial aspect. Dad is right, I cannot just drift all the time. I have to commit at some point. By the way, he told me to hug you from the family, both of you guys."_
>
> _"Send him our best wishes, dear. We will come visit maybe early next year, when it's still winter and there's not so much to do around here,"_ aunt Marie replied.
>
> _"I hope it may even be sooner. I miss you and your siblings so terribly. We don't see each other often, but I kind of think of you a bit as also my children,"_ uncle Phil interjected. I could see the honesty in that statement. However, he quickly apologized, as if coming to his sense:
> _"I'm sorry, that probably sounded weird. Of course you're my brother's kid, but you know, It's sometimes strange where the mind takes you. Must be the scenery here."_
>
> _"Just makes him contemplate, always the thinker, you know,"_ Marie hastily agreed.

It was still quite hot for September, so uncle Phil decided to prepare some fresh lemonade for us to enjoy. 

> _"I'm sorry if I come off snippy sometimes,"_ aunt Marie suddenly uttered.
>
> _"Oh I hadn't noticed anything like that."_

I really hadn't. 

> _"It's just that after more than two decades it's always very obvious when he's sad. He really wishes he could have spent more time with you guys. But he will be fine, it's just for the moment. Compromise and sacrifice are part of every relationship and one has to make sure not to wallow too much in one's own nobility,"_ she added.

When uncle Phil came back, he carried a big pitcher of dark yellow liquid, filled with slices of freshly cut lemons and at least 3 cups of ice. He marched towards us from the house, holding it in one hand, with the other steadying his beige summer hat. Condensation dripped from the glass onto the spotty grass, matching his pace.

The thirst-inducing image of the pitcher quickly soured as its color became more clearly discernible. It looked slightly murky in a concerning way. And the smell: It was putrid, much worse than the coffee. I leaned in to sniff, but immediately began retching.

> _"Oh, are you not feeling well, dear?,"_ Marie asked me, concerned.
>
> _"What's in this water? Something's not right here"_, I stated under my own heavy breath.
>
> _"Oh it's just the way the water is out here. There must be rust in the pipes or sediment in the cistern up on the hill."_, my uncle reassured me.
>
> _"We should renew the filter, it might not be strong enough anymore,"_ added Marie.
> _"But we're used to it."_

Before I could grasp the situation or even intervene, uncle Phil poured the liquid into their glasses and took a big sip.

> _"See? It just takes some getting used to, but this is how life is in the countryside. It actually had been much worse a few weeks ago, but was already getting better."_

I couldn't believe my eyes. This was not normal. I burst out:

> _"Can't you understand? Something's with the water. This is not something you can ignore!"_

They just looked at me in shock, like I was experiencing an out-of-the-blue teenage outburst.

> _"If you want we also have soda in the——"_

Before she could finish, I sprinted the roughly 50 yards up the hill. The water tank was buried, so I checked the collection system, but the gutters looked clean, nothing but a few early fallen leaves. I frantically circled around the hill, looking for a hatch so I could inspect the inside, but then I noticed this smell again. I squinted my eyes and scanned the surroundings until I saw an opening. Coming closer, I could tell it was the source of this horrendous smell. Apparently, the small hatch had been left open. I covered my nose and mouth with my shirt and looked inside, using my phone as a flashlight. Something was floating in there, something rotten. Both of them had now arrived on the hill. My uncle just looked at me while I tried to get a grip of the alien object. I had to lean in further, so I instructed him to hold my phone. I took one deep breath, filling my mouth with the maximum tolerable volume of foul gasses. As I brought my face so close to the opening that the tank's metal touched my one of my cheeks, I suddenly spotted a horn. A poor goat must have fallen in and drowned. Now seeing what it was I managed to grab onto it, trying to hoist it out using all my stength. With considerable effort, I was able to get the entire head out of the water, or rather what was left of it. I let out a deep groan and when the goat's lower neck finally breached the surface, the animal just fell apart. I can never forget the sloshing sound of its decomposing body falling back into the tanks' water. I immediately let go of the decomposing head, turned around and heaved like I never had before. Both of them were still just watching me, absentmindedly, as if I was just performing some inexplicable ritual.

I still feel sick thinking about this. Who knows how long they had been drinking that water.

Before I left, I pleaded with them to get a new water source. Can't be too hard to get the permits needed to dig a well. But they only wanted to hire someone to deep clean the cistern.

> _"You know, kid. Sometimes it's just too late."_

As I walked down the hill back to my rental car looking back at the house and the meadow, I decided to take some time off before thinking about what I should do next.
