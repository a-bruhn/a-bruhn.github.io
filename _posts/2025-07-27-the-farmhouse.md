Last September I decided to visit my uncle Phil and his wife Marie at their old farmhouse. I hadn't been there in many years and the last time I saw them was at my high school graduation, when they flew over to visit. We always had a great relationship and messaged each other regularly. We even talked on the phone every couple of weeks, although he did most of the talking while Marie was always somewhere in the background, doing some menial but important work around the house, faintly audible only when it was necessary to provide a helpful reminder or correction to my uncle's memory. I knew he would be delighted to see me again and it was long overdue, but my motivation make the trip at that point was in part selfish. I had recently decided to switch majors, again. I just couldn't see myself in human resources. Not that I could see myself doing anything else exclusively for the next 50 years of my life, but at least it wouldn't be in HR. My parents, of course, had been distraught. And even then I could totally see their point. I had promised them before that this would be the right transition for me, something grounded and with good career opportunities, after I just couldn't take psychology any longer. I knew they would still support me, but after all the talking and negative aura, I just needed some affirmation by my favorite uncle. In typical uncle fashion, he always assured me that I should do what feels right for me. Since I was young, what really mattered was that I didn't rush into anything or feel pressured into doing something mainly to please others. 

The house was sat on a shallow slope and quite large. Driving along the hilly countryside, the off-white color of its wooden paneling emerged into view poetically. It brought back memores of watching the diving team train that summer. The aqueous film attractively diffusing the sun's light in all directions when they burst back to the surface after a complex maneuver. I had to park some ways down the hill, since I hadn't booked early enough to snatch an off-road rental car. There was a large backyard with lots of homegrown produce and on the other side, facing the hill a breathtaking wild meadow. It wasn't really that wild, as uncle Phil was always proud to proclaim, since it still needed a lot of effort to keep it in its current state, but the sheer diversity of wild flowers and weeds, the patterning of white, purple, red, and yellow petals, the relief of different sized stalks—I could feel it brushing against my palms as I imagined my giant's hand caressing the landscape, as I had sometimes done as a child. It was just so gorgeous, I immediately regretted deciding earlier against packing my Z6. The afternoon I visited, we sat in full view of the meadow, below a giant oak tree, on a set of collapsible chairs around a metal garden table with a clipped-on rubbery tablecloth, the sound of insects buzzing enveloping us.

The house belonged to Marie's parents. After they died in the 00's, uncle Phil and her moved in. This meant being away from his brother (my father) and us at the coast, but Marie could not let go of her childhood home and how could you say no to such an estate. They sold off the farmland but kept the house and nearly two acres of garden.  Since then, the house itself has somewhat fallen into disrepair—not by much, but it was obvious that greater renovations were overdue. They never seemed like they had money problems: both had been successful in their careers and managed to retire way ahead of what the vast majority of people could even dream of, including my parents. On top of that, my uncle still composed for smaller movies and video games from time to time with considerable success. Somehow, yet, the house and shed seemed to only have received surface-level repairs over the last few decades.

Aunt Marie went to get coffee as we sat taking in the surroundings. I couldn't remember it being so beautiful here.

>
> _"I cannot imagine this ever getting old, uncle Phil. Everything is so alive."_
>
> _"You know, I've spent an uncountable amount of hours here. And you're right, it doesn't get old. It just feels more and more wistful with every year. You look out so much into the dawning meadow, the hills and everything—it makes you contemplate too much,"_ he said.
>
> _"Before you start contemplating too much again, let's have some coffee and sugar-cookies",_ Marie interjected, carrying a big carafe and an artfully plated dish, the cookies' large sugar crystals twinkling in the afternoon sun.

I had always loved these as a child, and even as a teenager during a time where I used to be a terribly picky eater, I would eat a dozen of those whenever we visited. Aunt Marie poured our coffee into the fine moss rose cups with fine pinkish enameled flowers—no doubt an heirloom from her family—that were placed out on the cheap-ish garden table. I relished in the contrast this provided. This more natural life was much different from the carefully crafted setting at coffee shops in the city or even my parents' house. I began to notice the smell of the coffee, however, which not mix well with the sweetness of the cookies and the late summer air. Looking closer at the cups, I could see lot's of micro-cracks in them, only visible due to the dark murky coffee filling into them, thus providing the required contrast to discover them. Given their age of at least a hundred years, they were still in very good shape, just not as immaculate as I had first presumed. Bringing the cup to my face, the smell of the coffee became harsher and nearly foul. Since there are all kinds of different types of coffee beans, I brought myself to take a sip, maybe this was a variety like those brewed from beans that were digested by monkeys before being picked up. I also didn't want to have them think I'm the typical caramel macchiato college student type (although in reality I really was). But, the taste was also terrible, it tasted slightly foul.

> _"I'm sorry, but do you think the beans might have gone bad? The coffee tastes a bit off."_
>
> _"Oh I'm so sorry dear, this is how it always tastes. We are not really connoisseurs, we just like to drink a cup here and there and buy our beans in a 50 pound bag, when we drive out to the big chain store. We don't even know what kind we're buying, we just take the cheapest one,"_ Marie replied.
>
> _"You are probably used to a lot better coffee at your university,"_ uncle Phil added. I could see a bit of earnest shame in his face.

I immediately felt embarrassed having mentioned it. The conversation shifted to uncle Phil's newest project, an indie sci-fi film. I remember telling him that I admired that he could work creatively and never had to be a corporate drone. He agreed, which brought us back to the topic of our last phone call, my studies. Uncle Phil assured me:

> _"I know you're still searching for what you want to do with your life. The main thing is that you don't rush into things and don't just take the first path that just presents itself."
>
> _"I understand what you mean, but there is also a financial aspect. Dad is right, I cannot just drift all the time. I have to commit at some point. By the way, he told me to hug you from the family, both of you guys."_
>
> _"Send him our best wishes, dear. We will come visit maybe early next year, when it's still winter and there's not so much to do around here,"_ aunt Marie replied.
>
> _"I hope it may even be sooner. I miss you and your siblings so terribly. We don't see each other often, but I kind of think of you a bit as also my children,"_ uncle Phil interjected. I could see the honesty in that statement. However, he quickly apologized, as if coming to his sense:
> _"I'm sorry, that must have sounded weird. Of course you are my brother's, but you know, It's sometimes strange where the mind takes you. Must be the scenery here."_
>
> _"Just makes him contemplate, always the thinker, you know,"_ Marie hastily agreed.

It was still quite hot for September, so uncle Phil decided to prepare some fresh lemonade for us to enjoy. 

> _"I'm sorry if I come off snippy sometimes,"_ aunt Marie suddenly uttered..
>
> _"Oh I hadn't noticed anything like that."_

I really hadn't. 

> _"It's just that after more than two decades it's always very obvious when he's sad. He really wishes he could have spent more time with you guys. But he will be fine, it's just for the moment. Compromise and sacrifice are part of every relationship and one has to make sure not to wallow too much in one's own nobility,"_ she added.

When uncle came back, he carried a big pitcher of a dark yellow liquid with freshly cut lemons and at least 3 cups of ice. He marched towards us from the house, holding it in one hand, with the other holding onto his beige summer hat. The condensation dripped from the glass onto the spotty grass, mimicking his pace.

The thirst-inducing image of the pitcher quickly turned sour when the color became clearer. It looked murky in a concerning way. And the smell: It was putrid, much worse than the coffee. I tried bringing my nose closer to inspect it but immediately began retching.

> _"Oh are you not feeling well, dear?,"_ Marie asked me, concerned.
>
> _"What is in this water? Something's not right here"_, I stated under my own heavy breath.
>
> _"Oh it's just the way the water is out here. There must be rust in the pipes or the plumbing at the cistern up on the hill."_, my uncle reassured me.
>
> _"We should renew the filter, it might not be strong enough anymore,"_ added Marie.
> _"But we're used to it."_

Before I could grasp the situation or even intervene, uncle Phil poured the liquid into their glasses and took a big sip.

> _"See, it just takes some getting used to, but this is how life is in the countryside. It actually had been much worse a few weeks ago, but was already getting better."_

I couldn't believe my eyes. This was not normal. I screamed:

> _"Can't you understand? Something's with the water. This is not something you can ignore!"_

They just looked at me in shock, like I was experiencing an out-of-the-blue teenage outburst.

> _"If you want we also have soda in the——"_

Before she could finish, I sprinted the roughly 50 yards up the hill. The water tank was buried, so I checked the collection system, but the gutters looked clean, nothing but a few early fallen leaves. I frantically went around the hill in circles, looking for a hatch so I could inspect the inside, but then I noticed this smell again. I squinted my eyes and scanned the surroundings until I saw an opening. Coming closer, I could tell it was the source of this horrendous smell. Apparently, the small hatch had been left open. I covered my nose and mouth with my shirt and looked inside, using my phone as a flashlight. Something was floating in there, something rotten. Both of them had now arrived on the hill. My uncle just looked at me while I tried to grab the object, I could notice a horn. It must have been a goat. I grabbed it, trying to hoist it out using all my weight. I managed to get the entire head out of the water, or rather what was left of it. When the lower neck breached the surface, the goat just fell apart causing a terrible sloshing sound. I let go of the decomposing head, turned around and heaved like I never had before. Both of them were still just watching me, absentmindedly, as if I was just performing some inexplicable ritual.

I still feel sick thinking about this. Who knows how long they had been drinking that water.

Before I left, I pleaded with them to get a new water source. Can't be too hard to get the permits needed to dig a well. But they only wanted to hire someone to deep clean the cistern.

> _"You know, kid. Sometimes it's just too late."_
> 

As I walked down the hill back to my rental car looking back at the house and the meadow, I decided to take some time off before thinking about what I should do next.
