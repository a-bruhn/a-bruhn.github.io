Sustained dread—a lump in your throat. My aunt said this is how everyone felt during 9/11. I remember how I experienced something like it and how it lasted for days during Russia’s second invasion of Ukraine. It seems to be very precisely determinable, which in the broader category of feelings is quite extraordinary. It’s an exhaustion, an overwhelming sense of powerlessness, a cruel reminder on the illusory nature of agency. It makes it uncomfortably harder to breathe, but not so hard as to render oneself severly hypoxic—no, it just makes you acutely aware of the masses of air that have to be hauled into your lungs every few seconds. And then there are these somewhat absurd moments in-between, providing some room for sardonic introspection. You take another one of these heavy-duty breaths and suddenly find yourself boasting to your imaginary associates of the sizable tonnage you're moving across your somatic borders, briefly lifting your pretend trucker hat to fix your tired hair.

The reason, I think, this is so universal and consistent is that it is also very human—or animalistic if you want. There are these massive events: volcanoes discharging ashes and molten rock at enormous speeds, plagues moving ever closer from town to town, crops, supposed to feed your family, imperviously dying in front of your eyes, and of course, war. Catastrophe is part of our shared genetic heritage. We just kind of ignore all of this, until it suddenly manifests in front of you, forces itself into you, sensitizing your airways. Usually, normalcy creeps back into the forefront of your state of mind and after a few days, the massive 100-feet high wave hurrying towards the shore akin to the climax of a Roland Emmerich disaster flick, somehow disappears back behind the horizon.

But what if something happens that it doesn’t? What if there is an event so violently apparent that it leaves no space at all, not even for fatigue?

We received their message on June 6 of last year. That was 7 months ago, and I have not taken a single non-conscious breath since. Societal collapse had been part of the public discourse my entire life. Even before, there had already been ample reasons for it, none of them really having disappeared since then. Yet, the boundaries of our destructive imagination seem to not have stretched out far enough both into space and into our own mental landscape.
