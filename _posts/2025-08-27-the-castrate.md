I watched the young stag  
nourish from  
the coolness of a creek  

The scarlet freshness  
on his hide telling cruelly  
of a summer cut short by providence  

Soon, the break of night uncovers  
solitary Mars  
abandoned now by his  
companion moons  

Pacing along the city walls  
he yet remains  
forever on the cusp of knowing  

And from afar  
I hear him  
preaching the gospel of  
a long-forgotten saint  

As I sit beside the window  
once more re-reading the letter  
I had not the heart to send
