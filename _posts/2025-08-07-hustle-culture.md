On a typical Wednesday morning, Henry was on his way to work as a level 2 data analyst at a mid-sized insurance company. As usual, he listened to motivational podcasts while walking to the subway station nearest to his apartment. On this week's episode of _The Grind with Jayden Miakis_, a multi-millionaire day-trader gave his insights into how to make big bank like him. His biggest take was that you "_gotta make room for the mind, bro. Read some of that Marcus Aurelius in-between sets at the gym instead of just consuming stuff on your phone"_. Henry could only agree—even if he did not go to the gym, or day-trade. But after all, do we not waste our lives mindlessly gulping down bite-sized information without any of it having any impact on our lives, changing our trajectory not in the slightest—all of it just being random perturbations to a fixed path. "_Today_," he thought to himself, "_I will go out of my comfort zone and make an impact!_"

As he walked along the abandoned property, where a few years ago was still a movie theater, he noticed a blue-ish cart on the grass near the sidewalk. At first he didn't pay it much attention, as it looked just like a food truck at the park near his office, where he sometimes gets surprisingly good tacos for lunch. As he approached, he could make out the lettering: *"Roadside Surgery"* and thought it funny: "_must be a novelty artisanal ice cream or Korean waffle donut_." He noticed the cart had seen better days, but that was not unusual. Most of the time, these trucks have seen many rounds of owners and only ever get a new paint job in-between enterprises. On this particular specimen, some rusty spots were very noticeable through the thin coat of glossy paint. And yet, Henry felt intrigued to take a closer look. He could really go for a snack before heading to the office and since he had no meetings before 10 a.m., there was no harm in arriving a few minutes late. Unfortunately, the serving window was shuttered down. But there was a sign with an arrow pointing to the side that instructed customers to come to the back hatch. Peculiar as this was, Henry did not mind and followed the instructions. As he arrived at the back hatch, a whiff of antiseptic hit him and he saw an older man in a white coat scrubbing metallic cutlery in the cart's tiny plastic sink. As he notices Henry, he turned around with a big warm smile to greet him: 

> "_Hello, there! What can I get you from our menu?_"
>
> "_What menu? I don't see any food items listed. What's your specialty?_"
>
> "_Oh I'm sorry"_, said the man in the white coat and moved to the side.
>

At the back wall, Henry could now read "_Each body part only $25_".

> "_Goes without saying though, I can only take something off, never attach,_" the white-cloaked vendor added. "_You'd be surprised how few people read the disclaimer._"
>

Henry thought about it for a while, and was about to leave, as he remembered his promise to himself from just a few minutes ago. Did he really want to waste another opportunity and just arrive at work as usual, do the required amount of work, and then head home again and be depressed? No! I don't want to continue like this! The stench of sticky keyboards, of break room yogurt containers, and sweaty team building exercises—to hell with it. _Odor laboris_, not any more! 

> "_Let's get rid of the nose, doc._", proclaimed Henry energetically.
>
> "_Excellent choice! That'll be 25 bucks, my friend._"
>

An hour later, as Henry swiped his key-card at the office elevator, he began to feel self-conscious. How would his colleagues react to his transformation. No one said a word to his new haircut last week, but this change was a bit more on the nose. He had a good chuckle at this ad-hoc wordplay as the elevator moved up to his floor. 

As expected, nothing unusual happened until lunch and none of his colleagues mentioned anything, although there were a bewildered looks to the gaping opening in the center of his face. And yet, he was in good spirits as he entered the communal kitchen nook in the break room to grab a snack. The smell of the sink and the surrounding accumulation of unwashed coffee mugs and used dishes dumped there by his colleagues just did not bother him anymore. "_I made a great choice._" Emboldened, he decided to be the one to do something against the decay of the break room, pulled up his sleeves and began washing the dishes. Food residue and slightly moldy teabags did not seem half as bad, if you didn't have to smell them. As he was about to finish, he heard a voice call out to him:

> "_Wow Henry, your a real go-getter, aren't you. I'm positively surprised. You even look like you enjoyed the extra work._"
>
>"_Thank you, Tobias, doing my best,_" Henry confidently replied to the regional director without much turning his head, putting the last dishes onto the drying rack.
>

The afternoon, and in fact the next few days were even better. Henry was full of energy and began to get more and more attention from his peers. He felt like he really started making a name for himself at the company. Suddenly, other people approached him to ask for his advice, which he generously shared even if he had not much to add in most cases. The cart hadn't re-appeared, which wasn't surprising, maybe it was moving around and parking somewhere else every day. But he didn't want anything else anyway. Henry was content with the current situation.

Still, the following Wednesday, as he neared the corner from which he had first spotted *"Roadside Surgery"* just a week before, he began to feel nervous. What if it never appeared again? How would he then get ahead? Alas, there it was, standing at the same spot. the windows still shuttered down. Henry went around the side to check for the doctor. Henry could not see him inside, but as he moved closer, he felt a hand on his shoulder:

> "_Hello my friend, are you satisfied with your last purchase?_"
>
> "_Very much so. I just came by to give you my regards for the well executed operation_," replied Henry.
>
> "_Very well, I'm glad to hear it. Can I get you anything today? Maybe an arm? Th right one or the left?_"
>
> "_No I don't think I need anything today._" Henry hesitated. "Just in case, what was the price again?_"
>
> "_Still $25 fix—although, we have combos. I can take two arms for $35. Once the saw is dirty, there's not much additional effort. The manpower goes mostly into the cleaning up afterwards._"
>

Arriving at work, Henry felt more confident than ever. Everyone was staring at him. He could feel their jealous eyes on him. He was positively beaming. When his boss saw Henry's new appearance, he re-assigned an assistant to him. His own assistant, Henry couldn't believe it. No more writing reports by himself! 

As the days went by, Henry got invited to more and more meetings. The amount of overlapping rectangles in his outlook calendar was mind-boggling. People he had never heard of, important people in the company, wanted 1:1 time with him. The sheer amount of introductions and strategy talk took all of Henry's power and every night after work he crashed onto his bed like a felled tree.

At least, though, he did not need to worry about finding the doc the following Wednesday. A week prior, as he had asked him whether he would station his cart again at the same street. 

> "_Of course, as long as I have customers here I will come,_" had the doc replied.
>

And so, another week passed and Henry did not need to introduce himself to people any more. He could—he just wouldn't be able to understand the other party, as the doc had removed both his outer and inner ears. All that for just $35. Henry wondered, how the man could make a living with these prices. His new situation required some further adjustments and so he devised the five-page memo, which was _one more efficient than the industry standard._ Handing him their memos, all the colleagues who just a month ago would not care for his opinion one bit, now feared his critique and deeply valued his feedback. Somehow, he managed to become the central technical authority in his business unit. All this within the span of a few weeks. 

And so, another successful week had passed. Had his words carried enormous weight before, Henry could now bring about re-organizations of entire departments with just the motion—or lack thereof—of his brows, as he had the doc take out his lips and larynx. Since they both are technically different organs, he had to pay the full price of $50, but it was still very much worth it and with his new responsibilities, Henry's increase in pay made more than up for it. 

One report, drafted by his old department for that matter, was particularly underwhelming in both style and results. This was of course an embarrassing situation for him, as he had taken considerable pride in his old situation and expected only the best work from his former colleagues. The re-organization was swift and within the same day, nine under-performers had to clean out their desks, as the rest were merged with another department. 

Henry was very pleased with himself and so was the C-suite, which had long taken note of him and the steady leadership he had over his business unit. The success of the company could rest easily on his stubby shoulders.
