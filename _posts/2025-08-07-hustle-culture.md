Henry put his earbuds in and tried to zone out a bit before entering another boring day of meetings and reports. In the intro of this week's episode of _The Grind with Jayden Miakis_, a successful day-trader—by his own account worth at least 10 mil—was hyped up to share some insights on how to make big bank like him. As the sponsors of the show peddled their solution to all of life's problems, Henry locked the door of his apartment and began heading toward the subway station two blocks over. As a level-2 data analyst at a mid-sized insurance firm, this Wednesday did not promise the endorphine-drenched gains any of the guests on _the Grind_ experienced in their day-to-day. Still, it wasn't _nothing_. The guest's deepest take was that you _"gotta make room for the mind, bro. Read some of that Marcus Aurelius between sets at the gym instead of just consuming stuff on your phone"_. Henry couldn't agree more—even if he didn't go to any gym, or day-trade for that matter. But after all, don't we just waste most of our day mindlessly gulping down bite-sized infotainment without any of it having any impact on our lives, changing our trajectory not in the slightest—all of it just random perturbations to a fixed path canceling each other out. Feeling assured in his philosophy, he made a promise to himself. He knew he had probably made similar ones multiple times in the past and then forgotten them again, but this time will be different: _"Today,"_ he thought, _"I will go out of my comfort zone and make an impact!"_

As he rounded the corner and began walking along an abandoned lot, where a few years ago had still been a movie theater, he noticed something new—a bright blue cart on the unregulated grass near the sidewalk. At first he didn't pay it much attention, as it looked just like a food truck at the park near his office, where he sometimes went to have some surprisingly good tacos for lunch. The thought alone of freshly squeezed lemon dripping from his fingers and the sharp herbal smell of cilantro was mouth watering. _"Maybe they got something quick and tasty for the road."_ As he got closer, he could make out the lettering: *"Roadside Surgery"* and chuckled: _"must be artisanal ice cream or a novelty Korean waffle-donut hybrid. They know how the business works. You gotta have a great hook to lure in customers. They should consider a better location though."_ Upon further inspection, he noticed that the cart had seen better days, but that was not unusual. Most of the time, these trucks have seen many rounds of owners and only ever get a new paint job in-between enterprises. On this particular specimen, some rusty spots were very noticeable through the thin coat of glossy paint. And yet, Henry felt intrigued to peek around a bit. He could now really go for a snack before heading to the office and since he had no meetings before 10 a.m., there was no harm in arriving a few minutes late. Unfortunately, the serving window was completely shuttered down except for a small gap at the bottom. With piqued interest, Henry bent forward to take a look inside what kind of cuisine they were offering. Before he could make out anything a voice called out to him from the inside: _"Hey there, mister! The window's malfunctioning, why don't you come around the side to the back of the cart."_ Peculiar as this was, Henry was now invested. As he arrived at the back hatch, a strong whiff of antiseptic hit him. Inside, he saw an older man in a white coat vigorously scrubbing metallic cutlery in the cart's tiny plastic sink. His arms were enveloped in extra-long teal rubber gloves extending nearly up to his shoulders, their sides lined with pinkish bubbles. At unpredictable intervals, his forceful movements caused small clusters of them to detach, slowly floating to the cart's crimson linoleum floor, where they ultimately vanished into small puddles. Frantic tufts of white hair held onto the sides of his otherwise bald head like windblown beachgrass. There was an energy to his actions, that gave the old man an oddly youthful vibe. As he noticed Henry, he turned around with a big warm smile to greet him: 

> _"Hello, there! What can I get you from our menu?"_
>
> _"What menu? I don't see any food items listed. What's your specialty?"_
>
> _"Oh I'm sorry"_, said the man in the white coat and moved to the side.
>

At the back wall, there was a plastic sign, where Henry could now read in big letters _"Each body part only $25"._

> _"Goes without saying though, I can only take something off, never attach,"_ the white-cloaked vendor added. _"You'd be surprised how few people actually read the disclaimer below the price."_
>

Henry thought about it for a while, and was already about to leave, as he remembered his promise to himself from just a few minutes ago. Did he really want to waste another opportunity and just arrive at work as usual, do the required amount of work, and then head home again and be depressed? _"No! I don't want to continue like this! The stench of sticky keyboards, of break room yogurt containers, and sweaty team building exercises—to hell with it. Odor laboris, not any more!"_ 

> _"Let's get rid of the nose, doc,"_ Henry proclaimed energetically.
>
> _"Excellent choice! That'll be 25 bucks, my friend."_
>

An hour later, as Henry swiped his key-card at the office elevator, still with the taste of iron on his tongue, he began to feel self-conscious. How would his colleagues react to his transformation? No one said a word to his new haircut last week, but this change was a bit more on the nose. He had a good chuckle at this ad-hoc wordplay as the elevator moved up to his floor. 

As expected, nothing unusual happened until lunch and none of his colleagues mentioned anything, although there were a few slightly bewildered looks as to the gaping double opening in the center of his face. And yet, he was in good spirits as he entered the communal kitchen nook in the break room to finally grab a well-deserved snack. The smell from the sink drain and the surrounding accumulation of unwashed mugs and dishes dumped there by his colleagues just didn't bother him anymore. _"I made a great choice,"_ he thought to himself. Invigorated, he decided to be the person to finally do something against the decay of the break room. He pulled up his sleeves and began washing the dishes. Scrubbing off food residue and touching slightly moldy teabags did not seem half as bad, if you didn't have to smell them. As he was about to finish, he heard a voice call out to him:

> _"Wow Henry, you're a real go-getter, aren't you. I'm positively surprised. You actually look like you’re enjoying the extra work."_
>
> _"Thank you, Toby, doing my best,"_ he confidently replied to the regional director without much turning his head, as he put the last dishes onto the drying rack.
>

The afternoon, and in fact the next few days were even better. Henry was full of energy and began to garner more and more attention from his peers. He felt like he really started to make a name for himself at the company. Suddenly, other people approached him to ask for his advice, which he of course generously shared even if he had not much to add in most cases. So far, the cart hadn't re-appeared. This wasn't very surprising, maybe it was moving around and parking somewhere else every day. But he didn't want anything else anyway. He was content with the current situation.

Still, the following Wednesday, as he neared the corner from which he had first spotted *"Roadside Surgery"* just a week prior, he began to feel nervous. What if it never appeared again? Now, he's on top, but what if that effect tapered off? He could already sense the cold grasp of diminishing returns. Without intervention, how could he then get ahead? Alas, there it was, standing at the same spot, flattening the lot's overgrown grass to all sides, the counter still shuttered down. Just like the last time, Henry went around the side to check for the doctor. But he couldn't see him inside. The metal cutlery was neatly organized into different sized containers or hung up on the wall. Without the presence of the doc, the contrast of the bright blue interior walls and red flooring seemed all the more striking. It really looked a lot more like a pita truck than a surgery room. Suddenly, he felt a hand on his shoulder:

> _"Hello my friend, I was just taking out the trash. Are you satisfied with your last purchase?"_
>
> _"Very much so. I just came by to give you my regards for the well executed operation,"_ replied Henry.
>
> _"Very well, I'm glad to hear it. Can I get you anything today? Maybe an arm? The right one or the left?"_
>
> _"No I don't think I need anything today."_ Henry hesitated. _"But just in case, what was the price again?"_
>
> _"Still $25 flat—although, we have combos. I can take two arms for $35. Once the saw is dirty, there's not much additional effort. The manpower goes mostly into the cleaning up afterwards."_
>

Arriving at work, Henry felt more confident than ever. Everyone was staring at him. He could feel their jealous eyes on him. Sleek as a rocket having just jettisoned its spent side boosters, he was on an unstoppable trajectory toward upper management. He was positively beaming with confidence and pride. When his boss took notice of Henry's new appearance, he immediately re-assigned an assistant to him. His own assistant, Henry couldn't believe it. No more writing reports by himself! 

As the days went by, Henry got invited to more and more meetings. The amount of overlapping rectangles in his outlook calendar was mind-boggling. People he had never heard of—important people in the company—wanted 1:1 time with *him*. The sheer amount of introductions and strategy talk took up all of Henry's energy and every night after work he crashed onto his bed like a felled tree trunk.

At least, though, he did not need to worry about finding the doc the following Wednesday. A week prior, as he had let go of both his arms, he asked him whether he would station his cart again at the same street. 

> _"Of course, as long as I have customers here I will come,"_ had the doc replied.
>

And so, another week passed and Henry did not need to introduce himself to people any more. He technically could—he just wouldn't be able to understand the other party any more, as the doc had removed both his outer and inner ears. _"All that for just $35!"_ Henry wondered, how the man could even make a living with these prices. 

His new situation required some further adjustments and so he devised the five-page memo, which was _one more efficient than the industry standard,_ as he proudly proclaimed. Handing him their memos, many employees who had outranked him before and who just a month ago wouldn't care for his opinion one bit, now feared his critique and deeply valued his feedback. As to his former equals, he began to sense a certain waryness from them. He attributed it to them being intimidated and also a bit jealous of his sudden ascent. But he was not resentful. He once had been like them: going about his work without listening to the advice of the most experienced people in the company. With great effort though, he had managed to become the central technical authority in his business unit. All this within the span of a few weeks. 

And so, another successful week had passed. Had his words carried enormous weight before, Henry could now bring about re-organizations of entire departments with just the motion—or lack thereof—of his eyebrows, as he recently had the doc unburden him of his lips and larynx. Since they both are technically different organs, he had to pay the full price of $50, but it was still very much worth it and with his new responsibilities, Henry's increase in pay made more than up for it. 

A delicate situation arose as one report, unfortunately drafted by his own former department, was particularly underwhelming in both style and results. This was of course an embarrassing situation for him, as he had taken considerable pride in his origins in this exact team and expected only the best work from his former colleagues. They must have mistakenly assumed that this soft spot in his heart could be taken advantage of so they could slack off. The following re-organization was therefore swift and within the same day, nine under-performers had to clean out their desks, as the rest of the employees were merged with another department. Henry could be very pleased with himself and so was the C-suite, which had long taken note of him and the steadfast leadership he had assumed over his business unit. As he was told in a joyful tone on more than one occasion, the success of the company could rest easy on his stubby shoulders.
