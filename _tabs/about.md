A digital garden is a collection of interlinked notes. In contrast to a blog, it is not a linear sequence of finished articles, but a place to cultivate and refine ideas over time. In my case, these might be short stories, story fragments, drafts, or just ideas. Often, it might just be something I found interesting and wanted to bring into a digestible format.
